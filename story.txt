Onc upon a time, there was a guy named Ned. 
He loved exploring new places and cultures. 
He travelled across the world, made hundreds of new friends; every day was a new adventure for him. 
He was happy and living his life to the fullest. 
But all this came to a sudden stop, when Ned bumped into someone strange while he was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.  

The stranger offered him three wishes if he found three items for him.
The only problem was, getting two of these items required him breaking the law.
He was torn, he thought he had already achieved total happiness, but what if the three wishes would really make him happy?

He realized that in order to get the wishes, he had to steal a penny from a bank, steal a roll of toilet paper from a store, and get 
long lost treasure from Jack Sparrow's crew. The figured that with the wishes, he could easily undo the bad he had done, so he decided
to set out for the three items. The first two were easy to get, but the treasure was a whole different story.
